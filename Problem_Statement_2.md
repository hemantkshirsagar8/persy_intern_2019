## Problem Statement 2:
### Object Detection using Tensorflow:
Object detection using Machine Learning and Deep learning is tredind topic now days. Using Tensorflow, YOLO, scikit learn we can easily detect any object from given image, video or live stream.

Train a model to detect and classify object like 'Helmet' from image, video and live stream with its confidence value. Detecting Helmet will be useful use-case for traffic police, roas safety and at other manufacturing companies where helmets are compulsary for workers.
Accurately automating this process using AI/ML will reduce human efforts, human accidents/casualties.

Techinolgies:
1. Tensorflow Object detection.
2. OpenCV.
3. Python.
4. Google colab.

Process:
1. Research this topic properly.
2. Collect required images from google, cellphone or from kaggle.
3. Build, train and test your model at colab with GPU.
4. Shoot and upload real time demo video at YouTube.

Submission:
1. Your youtube video link for demo video.
